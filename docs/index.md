# Welcome to the FPGA Workflow Documentation

This is the documentation page for the FPGA Workflow project. Be sure to visit our Github page [here](https://github.com/Galactius/fpga-workflow-research) or by clicking the "Github" button at the bottom left corner of the page for more information.  

## Project Background

The FPGA Workflow Research Project seeks to develop a new workflow towards prototyping and developing FPGA's. The current process for developing FPGA code and setting it up on an FPGA involves either going through a Cloud FPGA provider or sourcing a physical FPGA device. In our project, I made use of AWS's F1 FPGA instances, as well as AWS's other general computing devices to compile FPGA source files into an executable, which would then be executed on an F1 instance. Getting setup to run an F1 instance is not particularly difficult, but it is an involved process that requires some background knowledge about FPGA's. Some conflicting doucmentation makes it slightly more difficult to keep track of everything in the process. 

Our overarching goal with this project is to make FPGA's more accessible for general computing by simplifying the FPGA deployment, prototyping, and development process and providing more information about each step in the process.  

This project began in Spring 2022, and continued into Summer 2022. where I was hired as a full-time research assistant that summer. This project was intended to be presented at Villanova's 2022 Research Symposium and potentially be submitted to SC2022, however those plans will be determined at the end of the summer based on our progress. 

I began writing the documentation for this project on May 7th, 2022, and intend to continue adding to it until the project is complete or another researcher picks up the primary role in the project. The most recent overhaul to this website was on June 13, 2022.
